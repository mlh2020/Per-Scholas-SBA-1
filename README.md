## A set of demo pages for my first skills based assessment at Per Scholas

This project was meant to serve as an assessment of skills learned in my first technical unit at my software engineering boot camp.

The requirements for this project are as follows:

- Have at least three pages
- Include forms, tables, and dropdowns
- Incorporate some text, images, and GIFs

## Lorem Ipsum Records

For this assignment I chose to make a site for a fictional record label.
Included in this site:

- A page for showing artists on the label
- A page for displaying the labels music catalog
